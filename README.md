# MovieGenreClassification
## Machine Learning Algorithms:
### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
### The Naive Bayes Algorithm
This project is based on above mentioned algorithms to do the classification for the movie genre.
In this project, Data Analytics, NLP(Natural Language Processing) to classify the movies on the basis of different genres.Wikipedia movie plots are used as the dataset which have the data scraped from the Wikipedia.Natural Language Processing is used to pre-process the data to use that in the classification using two machine learning algorithms i.e. Na√Øve Bayes and Support Vector Machine.
This resulted in an accurate and effective model which can differentiate different movie genre on the basis of plot summaries.
